# theory-proj1
The members of our team, Team Avatar, were Luke Napierkowski and Marcus Schimizzi. We spent about twelve hours each on the project, almost entirely simultaneously together. We used github, as suggested to share our code. This was especially useful when it came to reusable functions, as we split up the programs, taking the lead on different ones while still consulting and collaborating with one another. This also allowed us to test the programs with the given test files on a single computer so as to reduce procedural differences among tests. We used Python for our code as it is very coder-friendly, though it probably cost us in run time. The only imported libraries we used were time, to time the programs, and sys, to take arguments. The main data structures we used were dictionaries and lists. We used the dictionaries to represent the wffs, as these had a number of descriptive traits that were useful to refer to. We used the lists to store most of the numerical information, such as what variables had been assigned, what they had been assigned to, what clauses were satisfied and unsatisfied, and what the clauses contained, among other things. We used lists as stacks in cases when we needed to backtrack down a path.
